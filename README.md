All the data science projects and code are stored here.

Coded few ML algorithms from scratch using python.

•	Spam Filter- Developed a spam filter using Machine learning and Natural language processing using a SMS dataset. The algorithm used was Naïve Bayes and achieved an accuracy of 99% with and without cross validation. Laplace smoothing was used to improve the model and Count vectorizer for preprocessing.
•	Salary Predictor- Built a system by scratch that predicts the salary of a person using machine learning using the dataset from UCI repository. The algorithms were written from scratch in python and were Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Categorical Naïve Bayes. The preprocessing included filling missing values.
